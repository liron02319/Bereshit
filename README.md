#  Bereshit Project

**Welcome to Bereshit Project !**  
  In This project we simulate a successful landing with Bereshit spacecraft.  
  In addition, a report explaining the causes of the Bereshit crash is attached.

## Background
The Israeli spacecraft "Beresheet", launched by SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries, was intended to be the first private spacecraft to land on the Moon.   
On April 11, 2019, during the final landing phase, a technical malfunction occurred, leading to a loss of control and a crash on the lunar surface.

## Causes of the spacecraft crash
- IMU2 issue
- Mission rushed (more additional testing required)
- Low cost materials
- Low experienced crew
- System restarts
- Data transfer block
- "Critical control commands were not pre-programmed into the system but were instead loaded into RAM during the mission."
