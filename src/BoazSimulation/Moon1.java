/**
 * The Moon class provides basic physical constants and a method for calculating
 * a simplified model of lunar gravitational acceleration based on horizontal speed.
 * The data is based on information from the Hebrew Wikipedia article on the Moon.
 *
 * Constants:
 * - RADIUS: Radius of the Moon in meters (3475 km)
 * - ACC: Surface gravitational acceleration on the Moon in m/sÂ²
 * - EQ_SPEED: Approximate horizontal speed at which gravitational acceleration is reduced to zero
 *
 * Methods:
 * - getAcc(double speed): Returns a reduced gravitational acceleration based on the input speed,
 *   using a simple linear model where acceleration decreases as speed approaches EQ_SPEED.
